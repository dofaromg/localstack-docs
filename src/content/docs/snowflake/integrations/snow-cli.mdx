## Introduction

Snowflake CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) for Snowflake. You can use Snowflake CLI to interact with the Snowflake emulator. Snowflake CLI provides a set of commands to manage and interact with Snowflake accounts, databases, warehouses, and more.

You can connect Snowflake CLI to the Snowflake emulator using a connection profile. A connection profile is a set of parameters that define the connection to a Snowflake account. You can create, list, and test connection profiles using Snowflake CLI.

## Configuring Snowflake CLI

In this guide, you will learn how to configure Snowflake CLI to interact with the Snowflake emulator using a `localstack` connection profile.

:::note
For installation instructions, follow the [official Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/installation/installation) for your operating system. This ensures you install the correct and most up-to-date version of the Snowflake CLI.

### Create a connection profile

To configure Snowflake CLI to interact with the Snowflake emulator, create a connection profile using the following command:

```bash
snow connection add \
    --connection-name localstack \
    --user test \
    --password test \
    --account test \
    --host snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud
```

You might be prompted to enter more optional parameters, such as the connection port, database name, warehouse name, authentication method, and more. These are however optional and can be skipped.

After a successful configuration, the `localstack` connection profile is ready to use.

### List your connection profiles

To list all the connection profiles configured in Snowflake CLI, execute the following command:

```bash
snow connection list
```

The output should be:

```bash
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| connection_name | parameters                                                      |
|-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| localstack      | {'account': 'test', 'user': 'test', 'password': '****',         |
|                 | 'host': 'snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud'}                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Test the connection

To test the connection to the Snowflake emulator, execute the following command:

```bash
snow connection test --connection localstack
```

The output should be:

```bash
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| key             | value                                |
|-----------------+--------------------------------------|
| Connection name | localstack                           |
| Status          | OK                                   |
| Host            | snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud |
| Account         | test                                 |
| User            | test                                 |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Run a query using the connection profile

To run a query using the connection profile, execute the following command:

```bash
snow sql --query "CREATE DATABASE mytestdb;" --connection localstack
```

You can see all the databases in your Snowflake emulator using the following command:

```bash
snow sql --query "SHOW DATABASES;" --connection localstack
```

You can create a schema using the following commands:

```bash
snow sql --query "CREATE SCHEMA mytestdb.mytestschema;" --connection localstack
```
